> #### All the folks that share there work on the internet!
> *  I pulled all the commands from the 2 above "Snippet Scripts" which do most of the work 
 and I add my own to make up this full script. This script displays the information on screen
 and a file in your /home/your-name under the name of the system "XXXXX.stat"...
> *  I merged all the scripts and commands to make it all work...
> *  I also wrote some of the code my self and modified a lot of it for better output... :D --Bruce E. Scott
